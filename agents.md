## 4. How We Work

### 4.1 Core Principles
1. **Teen‑Led Innovation** – Young builders lead real projects and own decisions.  
2. **Collaboration First** – We default to pairing, sharing context, and helping each other.  
3. **Learning by Doing** – We ship, get feedback, and iterate instead of waiting for “perfect”.  
4. **Community Impact** – We prefer projects that help other learners and local communities.

### 4.2 Decision Making
- **Technical decisions:**  
  Led by the engineering team (Yash, Devansh, Maryam, Kaustubh) with input from others.

- **Design & UX decisions:**  
  Led by Saksham, with feedback from devs and community where relevant.

- **Community & program decisions:**  
  Led by Aadrika, with community feedback and support from the team.

- **Major changes (brand, org‑level strategy, big launches):**  
  Require discussion with the co‑founders plus broad team alignment.

### 4.3 Project Workflow
1. **Ideation** – Open brainstorm, collect ideas from the community.  
2. **Planning** – Scope the MVP, set milestones, define roles.  
3. **Development** – Work in short sprints with regular check‑ins.  
4. **Review** – Code reviews, design reviews, and testing.  
5. **Deploy** – Staged rollout with monitoring and a rollback plan.  
6. **Iterate** – Use feedback, metrics, and retrospectives to improve.
